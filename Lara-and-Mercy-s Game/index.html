  </head>
  <body>
    <p>Lila’s objective is to get the best possible outcome today, but someone else is involved…
No one except the second player will know their intentions. They may help Lila, but they may want to ruin her day instead. The second player will get to delete a choice out of the ones available to accomplish what they want, leaving only the remaining for Lila.
Make the best possible choices for you.
