    <p class = "diary">12/04/2016<br>I have gotten into the habits of doing more things for myself. Even the smallest things seem to make a difference on the way I face my everyday life. I did not know caring for myself could end up helping this much.<br>
I finally decided to face something that I should have faced a while ago. I was right all along, and I am starting treatment tomorrow morning. It feels weird to write it out, but here it goes, with full honesty: General Anxiety Disorder. It’s not who I am, but it’s a part of me I need to accept. It’s a part of me that needs an extra help, and that is OK.<br>-  Lila
