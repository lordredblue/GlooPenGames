        I had a nightmare last night. It was as vivid as it was gruesome. <br>
        I wake up sweating, shaking uncontrollably. This is normal. <br>
        Every night I go to sleep with this heavy feeling on my chest, as if somehow its contents had solidified leaving only a heavy rock pressing against the rest of me.<br>
        It’s hard to breathe. I feel dread. What is there for me to fear? Everything. <br>
        Perhaps also nothing. It’s hard to know which one it will be each day. <br>
        I have been neglecting myself lately. I don’t feel focused enough to do anything about it. <br>
        I still have time before work... <br>
