# GlooPenGames
I was responsible for the development of much of the back-end code of these games.

Both of these games were written in javascript using node.js, express, and the socket.io libraries.
Additionally our test case of tempConverter is included and requires a local installation of mongoDB in order to run, as well as the above mentioned javascript libraries.
